## Overview



## Objectives:
1. Take what is implemented at the moment from previous laboratory works and put it in a web 
service / serveral web services.
2. The services should have implemented basic authentication and MFA (the authentication factors 
on the implementer's choice).
3. The web app needs to simulate user authorization and the way you authorise user is also a 
choice that needs to be done by the implementor.
4. As services that the application could provide, it could be used the classical ciphers. 
Basically the user would like to get access and use the classical ciphers, but they need to 
authenticate and be authorized.
